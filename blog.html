<h4>Hello World!
My name is Yazan, most people call me Zee, I'm starting a journey into the world of 
healthtech and role of artificial intelligence in the future of medicine. Inspired by my
recent reading selection of books on the history of human kind ("Sapiens" by Yuval Harari)
and history of sourdough bread ("Sourdough Culture" by Eric Pallant), I have decided
to do to AI in medicine what these authors did to their respective subjects.</h4>
