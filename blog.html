<h4>Hello World!
My name is Yazan, most people call me Zee, I'm starting a journey into the world of 
healthtech and role of artificial intelligence in the future of medicine. Inspired by my
recent reading selection of books on the history of human kind ("Sapiens" by Yuval Harari)
and history of sourdough bread ("Sourdough Culture" by Eric Pallant), I have decided
to do to AI in medicine what these authors did to their respective subjects.</h4>

<h3>Deep Learning:</h3>
<h4>Deep learning is the area of artificial learning that focuses on 
building neural networks. The topics are vast but mainly include the following:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>computer vision: teaching the computer to train on images/video and "learn" 
    patterns and analyze untrained images (e.g. self-driving cars recognizing if the object 
    infront of the car is a person or a stop sign)</li>
  <li>Natural Language Processing: teaching the computer to learn patterns of Language 
  and speach recognition (e.g. speech recognition in alexa/google home devices)</li>
  <li>Recommender Systems: teaching the computer to recognize patterns in tabular data 
  and provide recommendations based on this data (e.g. What to watch next on Netflix)</li>
</ul></h4>
